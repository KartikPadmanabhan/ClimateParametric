# CLIMATE MODELLING USING PARAMETER APPROACHES 

## ORACLE BIG DATA APPLIANCE DEMO

### Introduction

A parameteric approach makes assumptions about the distribution of the underlying population and its parameters from which the sample was taken. A main drawback for this modelling approach is that if the data deviates strongly from the assumptions, using a parameteric approach using results in improper conclusions.

In order to avert this problem, techniques like kstest (Koglomorov-Smirnoff Goodness of fit test) is used to ensure that the sample under consideration comes from a population with a specific distribution.

The demo exploits two of the most popular parametric methods on top of Oracle Big Data Appliance to model historic Rainfall Data for Nashville, TN.

* Maximum Likelihood Estimation
* Method Of Moments
